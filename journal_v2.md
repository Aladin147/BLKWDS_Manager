## 2025-07-03: Integration Test Runtime Fixes

Today we fixed the runtime issues in our integration tests. This work involved several key improvements:

1. **Created Integration Test Helpers**:
   - Implemented IntegrationTestHelpers class with retry logic
   - Added helper methods for finding widgets, tapping, and entering text
   - Added methods for waiting for app stability
   - Improved error handling for test failures

2. **Fixed Flaky Tests**:
   - Updated gear_checkout_flow_test.dart with retry logic
   - Updated booking_creation_flow_test.dart with retry logic
   - Updated project_management_flow_test.dart with retry logic
   - Added proper waiting mechanisms between test steps

3. **Improved Test Reliability**:
   - Enhanced widget finding with retry logic
   - Added proper waiting between UI interactions
   - Improved error reporting for test failures
   - Added more consistent test behavior across different environments

The integration tests now run more reliably, which is a significant step forward. The retry logic and improved waiting mechanisms help to handle timing issues that are common in integration tests.

Next steps include documenting the ValueNotifier state management approach and creating a comprehensive testing checklist.
