# BLKWDS Manager - Android Adaptation Plan

This document outlines the plan for adapting the BLKWDS Manager desktop application to run on Android tablets, specifically targeting Android Marshmallow (6.0) and 32-bit ARM architecture.

## 1. Project Setup

- [x] Create `android-marshmallow` branch from `beta` branch
- [ ] Update Flutter configuration for Android target
- [ ] Configure Android SDK settings in project
- [ ] Update app icons and splash screens for Android
- [ ] Configure Android manifest with basic app information

## 2. Platform-Specific Code Adaptation

### 2.1 Platform Detection

- [ ] Implement platform detection utility class
- [ ] Create platform-specific implementations where needed
- [ ] Add conditional logic for platform-specific features
- [ ] Test platform detection on both Windows and Android

### 2.2 Desktop-Only Code Guards

- [ ] Identify desktop-only code sections
- [ ] Implement platform guards around desktop-specific features
- [ ] Create Android alternatives for desktop-only functionality
- [ ] Test graceful fallbacks on Android

### 2.3 File Storage Paths

- [ ] Update file storage path handling for Android
- [ ] Create platform-specific path providers
- [ ] Implement migration strategy for existing data
- [ ] Test file operations on Android

## 3. Android-Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Permissions

- [ ] Identify required Android permissions
- [ ] Add permissions to Android manifest
- [ ] Implement runtime permission requests where needed
- [ ] Test permission flows on Android

### 3.2 Android Lifecycle Management

- [ ] Implement proper handling of Android lifecycle events
- [ ] Ensure database connections are properly managed
- [ ] Handle app pause/resume states
- [ ] Test app behavior during interruptions (calls, notifications)

## 4. UI/UX Adaptation

### 4.1 Touch Layout Optimization

- [ ] Review all screens for touch usability
- [ ] Increase touch target sizes where needed
- [ ] Implement touch-friendly alternatives for hover effects
- [ ] Test navigation flows with touch input

### 4.2 Responsive Design

- [ ] Test all screens in different orientations
- [ ] Ensure proper adaptation to different screen sizes
- [ ] Optimize layouts for tablet form factors
- [ ] Test on different Android tablet resolutions

### 4.3 Input Handling

- [ ] Adapt keyboard input handling for Android
- [ ] Implement touch-friendly form controls
- [ ] Ensure proper virtual keyboard behavior
- [ ] Test text input on Android

## 5. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile app performance on Android
- [ ] Optimize image loading and caching
- [ ] Reduce memory usage where possible
- [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Test app under low memory conditions

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Emulator Testing

- [ ] Test on Android emulator with various configurations
- [ ] Verify functionality across different Android versions
- [ ] Test on different virtual device sizes and densities

### 6.2 Device Testing

- [ ] Test on actual Android tablet(s)
- [ ] Verify performance on target hardware
- [ ] Test in real-world scenarios
- [ ] Gather feedback from test users

## 7. Build and Distribution

- [x] Configure build settings for 32-bit ARM
- [x] Create release signing configuration
- [x] Build debug APK
- [x] Build release APK
- [ ] Test installation process
- [ ] Prepare distribution method for testers

## 8. Documentation

- [ ] Update user documentation for Android-specific features
- [ ] Create Android-specific installation instructions
- [ ] Document known limitations on Android
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guide for Android users

## Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Setup | 1 day | Branch creation, initial configuration |
| Code Adaptation | 3-5 days | Platform detection, file paths, guards |
| UI Adaptation | 3-4 days | Touch optimization, responsive design |
| Testing | 2-3 days | Emulator and device testing |
| Build & Distribution | 1 day | Creating and distributing APK |
| Documentation | 1 day | Updating docs for Android |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| SQLite compatibility issues | High | Medium | Test early, prepare alternative implementation |
| Performance problems on tablets | High | Medium | Profile early, optimize critical paths |
| UI not suitable for touch | Medium | High | Redesign critical interactions for touch |
| File system permission issues | High | Medium | Implement robust error handling and user guidance |
| 32-bit ARM compatibility | High | Low | Test on target architecture early |

## Success Criteria

1. Application installs and runs on Android Marshmallow tablets
2. All core functionality works correctly on Android
3. UI is usable and responsive on touch screens
4. Performance is acceptable on target hardware
5. Data can be properly stored and retrieved
6. No critical crashes or data loss issues

## Next Steps

After successful adaptation to Android:
1. Gather feedback from tablet users
2. Implement improvements based on feedback
3. Consider supporting additional Android versions
4. Explore potential for phone form factor support
