# BLKWDS Manager Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-25

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the BLKWDS Manager application. It defines the types of tests to be implemented, testing priorities, and best practices for writing and maintaining tests.

## Testing Goals

1. **Increase Test Coverage:** Aim for at least 80% code coverage for critical components
2. **Prevent Regressions:** Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
3. **Document Expected Behavior:** Tests serve as documentation for how components should behave
4. **Improve Code Quality:** Testing encourages better code organization and separation of concerns

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, typically at the function or class level.

**Priority Areas:**
- Database Services (DBService, DBServiceWrapper)
- Controllers and Services
- Models and Data Transformations
- Utility Functions

**Best Practices:**
- Test one concept per test
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Mock dependencies to isolate the unit under test
- Test both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### 2. Widget Tests

Widget tests focus on testing UI components in isolation.

**Priority Areas:**
- Core UI Components (LoadingIndicator, CustomAppBar, etc.)
- Form Widgets
- List Items and Cards
- Screens with Complex UI Logic

**Best Practices:**
- Test widget rendering
- Test widget interactions (taps, scrolls, etc.)
- Test widget state changes
- Verify correct display of data
- Test error states and loading states

### 3. Integration Tests

Integration tests focus on testing how components work together.

**Priority Areas:**
- Key User Workflows (Booking Creation, Gear Check-out, etc.)
- Navigation Flows
- Data Persistence Flows

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on user-centric scenarios
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Verify data persistence
- Test error handling and recovery

## Testing Tools

- **Unit and Widget Tests:** Flutter's built-in testing framework
- **Mocking:** Mockito or manual mocks
- **Code Coverage:** Flutter's built-in coverage tools
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

```

## Testing Priorities

### Phase 1: Critical Components

1. **Database Services**
   - DBService CRUD operations
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Migration system
   - Integrity checks

2. **Core Models**
   - Model serialization/deserialization
   - Model validation
   - Model relationships

3. **Critical Controllers**
   - BookingController
   - GearController
   - ProjectController

### Phase 2: UI Components

1. **Core UI Components**
   - LoadingIndicator
   - CustomAppBar
   - Navigation Components

2. **Form Widgets**
   - Input Validation
   - Form Submission
   - Error Handling

3. **List and Grid Components**
   - Item Rendering
   - Selection Handling
   - Filtering and Sorting

### Phase 3: Integration Tests

1. **Booking Workflows**
   - Create, Edit, Delete Bookings
   - Assign Gear to Bookings

2. **Gear Management**
   - Check-out, Check-in Gear
   - Update Gear Status

3. **Project Management**
   - Create, Edit, Delete Projects
   - Assign Members to Projects

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- **Unit Tests:** `test('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', () { ... })`
- **Widget Tests:** `testWidgets('should [expected UI behavior] when [condition]', (tester) async { ... })`
- **Integration Tests:** `testWidgets('should [expected workflow outcome] when [user action]', (tester) async { ... })`

### Mocking Strategy

- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Create a standard set of mocks for common services
- Document mock behavior clearly

### Test Data

- Create helper functions for generating test data
- Use factory methods in model classes for test instances
- Keep test data realistic but minimal

## Code Coverage Goals

- **Critical Services:** 90%+
- **Models:** 90%+
- **Controllers:** 80%+
- **UI Components:** 70%+
- **Overall Application:** 80%+

## Continuous Integration

- Run all tests on every pull request
- Generate and publish code coverage reports
- Block merges if tests fail or coverage drops significantly

## Maintenance

- Review and update tests when requirements change
- Refactor tests when code is refactored
- Regularly review test coverage and identify gaps

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a framework for improving the quality and reliability of the BLKWDS Manager application. By following this strategy, we aim to create a robust test suite that ensures the application works as expected and remains maintainable as it evolves.
