# Integration Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing plan for integration tests in the BLKWDS Manager application.

## Overview

Integration tests in BLKWDS Manager focus on verifying that different parts of the application work together correctly and that critical user flows function as expected. These tests simulate real user interactions across multiple screens and components to ensure the application behaves correctly as a whole.

## Testing Approach

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test complete user flows from start to finish
   - Simulate real user interactions
   - Verify data persistence across screens
   - Test navigation between screens
   - Verify that all components work together correctly

2. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - 70% coverage of critical user flows
   - Focus on high-value business processes
   - Prioritize flows that involve multiple screens and components

3. **Testing Priority**
   - High: Gear check-in/out flow, Booking creation flow, Project management flow
   - Medium: Member management flow, Settings and data export flow
   - Low: Reporting and analytics flows

## Critical User Flows

### 1. Gear Check-in/out Flow

**Importance**: Highest - Core functionality of the application
**Complexity**: Medium - Involves multiple screens and components

**User Flow Steps**:
1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Select a member from the dropdown
3. Find a gear item in the list
4. Check out the gear to the selected member
5. Verify the gear status is updated
6. Check in the gear
7. Verify the gear status is updated again

**Test Cases**:
- Test successful gear check-out
- Test successful gear check-in
- Test gear check-out with notes
- Test gear check-in with notes
- Test error handling during check-out/check-in

### 2. Booking Creation Flow

**Importance**: High - Critical for studio and gear scheduling
**Complexity**: High - Complex form with multiple fields and validations

**User Flow Steps**:
1. Navigate to Booking Panel
2. Click "Create New Booking"
3. Fill in booking details (project, dates, etc.)
4. Select gear items
5. Assign gear to members
6. Save the booking
7. Verify the booking appears in the list
8. Verify the booking appears on the calendar

**Test Cases**:
- Test creating a new booking with all required fields
- Test validation of required fields
- Test date range selection
- Test gear selection and assignment
- Test booking conflict detection
- Test error handling during booking creation

### 3. Project Management Flow

**Importance**: High - Projects are central to the application
**Complexity**: Medium - Form-based CRUD operations

**User Flow Steps**:
1. Navigate to Project Management
2. Create a new project
3. Edit the project
4. View project details
5. Delete the project

**Test Cases**:
- Test creating a new project
- Test editing an existing project
- Test viewing project details
- Test deleting a project
- Test validation of required fields
- Test error handling during project operations

### 4. Member Management Flow

**Importance**: Medium - Members are assigned to gear and bookings
**Complexity**: Medium - Form-based CRUD operations

**User Flow Steps**:
1. Navigate to Member Management
2. Create a new member
3. Edit the member
4. View member details
5. Delete the member

**Test Cases**:
- Test creating a new member
- Test editing an existing member
- Test viewing member details
- Test deleting a member
- Test validation of required fields
- Test error handling during member operations

### 5. Settings and Data Export Flow

**Importance**: Medium - Important for data backup and configuration
**Complexity**: Medium - Multiple operations with file system interaction

**User Flow Steps**:
1. Navigate to Settings
2. Export data to JSON
3. Export data to CSV
4. Import data from JSON
5. Reset app data

**Test Cases**:
- Test exporting data to JSON
- Test exporting data to CSV
- Test importing data from JSON
- Test resetting app data
- Test error handling during export/import operations

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: High Priority Flows**
   - Implement tests for Gear Check-in/out Flow
   - Implement tests for Booking Creation Flow
   - Implement tests for Project Management Flow
   - Review and refine tests

2. **Phase 2: Medium Priority Flows**
   - Implement tests for Member Management Flow
   - Implement tests for Settings and Data Export Flow
   - Review and refine tests

3. **Phase 3: Low Priority Flows**
   - Implement tests for remaining flows
   - Review and refine tests

## Test Execution

1. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test integration_test/
   ```

2. **Running Tests on a Device**
   ```bash
   flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart -d <device-id>
   ```

3. **Generating Coverage Reports**
   ```bash
   flutter test --coverage
   genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Integration Test Structure**
   - Use `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` to initialize the test binding
   - Use `tester.pumpWidget(MyApp())` to launch the app
   - Use `tester.pumpAndSettle()` to wait for animations to complete
   - Use `find` methods to locate widgets in the widget tree
   - Use `tap`, `enterText`, etc. to simulate user interactions
   - Use `expect` to verify the expected behavior

2. **Testing User Interactions**
   - Simulate real user interactions as closely as possible
   - Test complete flows from start to finish
   - Verify that data persists across screens
   - Test navigation between screens
   - Test error handling and recovery

3. **Testing Data Persistence**
   - Verify that data is saved correctly
   - Verify that data is loaded correctly
   - Verify that data is updated correctly
   - Verify that data is deleted correctly

4. **Testing Error Handling**
   - Test error cases and recovery
   - Verify that error messages are displayed correctly
   - Verify that the application recovers gracefully from errors

## Maintenance

1. **Updating Tests**
   - Update tests when user flows change
   - Add new tests for new user flows
   - Refactor tests when application code is refactored

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests on every pull request
   - Enforce minimum coverage thresholds
   - Block merges if tests fail

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a structured approach to testing the integration of different components in the BLKWDS Manager application. By following this plan, we can ensure that critical user flows function correctly and that the application behaves as expected as a whole.
