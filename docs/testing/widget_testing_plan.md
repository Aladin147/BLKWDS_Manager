# Widget Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing plan for the UI components in the BLKWDS Manager application.

## Overview

Widget tests in BLKWDS Manager focus on verifying that UI components render correctly, respond to user interactions appropriately, and integrate properly with their controllers. This testing plan identifies the most critical UI components and outlines a strategy for testing them.

## Testing Approach

1. **Widget Testing**
   - Test each widget in isolation
   - Mock dependencies using Mockito
   - Test rendering, user interactions, and state changes
   - Verify proper integration with controllers

2. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - 70% code coverage for critical widgets
   - 50% code coverage for secondary widgets
   - Focus on testing user interactions and state changes

3. **Testing Priority**
   - High: Dashboard widgets, Booking form widgets, Gear management widgets
   - Medium: Calendar widgets, Settings widgets
   - Low: Static display widgets, purely decorative elements

## Critical Widgets

### 1. Dashboard Widgets

**Importance**: Highest - These are the main widgets on the app's primary screen
**Complexity**: High - Complex layouts and interactions with multiple data types

**Key Test Areas**:
- Dashboard layout rendering
- Gear list rendering and interactions
- Recent activity rendering
- Statistics card rendering
- Gear check-in/out dialog functionality

**Test Cases**:
- Test dashboard layout renders correctly
- Test gear list renders correctly with mock data
- Test gear list responds to user interactions (tap, long press)
- Test gear check-in dialog renders correctly
- Test gear check-out dialog renders correctly
- Test statistics cards render correctly with mock data
- Test recent activity list renders correctly with mock data

### 2. Booking Form Widgets

**Importance**: High - Critical for booking management
**Complexity**: High - Complex form with multiple fields and validations

**Key Test Areas**:
- Booking form rendering
- Form field validation
- Date picker functionality
- Gear selection functionality
- Member assignment functionality

**Test Cases**:
- Test booking form renders correctly
- Test form validation for required fields
- Test date picker opens and selects dates correctly
- Test gear selection dialog opens and selects gear correctly
- Test member assignment dialog opens and assigns members correctly
- Test form submission with valid data
- Test form submission with invalid data

### 3. Gear Management Widgets

**Importance**: High - Critical for gear management
**Complexity**: Medium - Forms and lists with filtering

**Key Test Areas**:
- Gear list rendering
- Gear form rendering and validation
- Gear filtering functionality
- Gear detail view rendering

**Test Cases**:
- Test gear list renders correctly with mock data
- Test gear list filtering works correctly
- Test gear form renders correctly
- Test gear form validation for required fields
- Test gear form submission with valid data
- Test gear form submission with invalid data
- Test gear detail view renders correctly

### 4. Calendar Widgets

**Importance**: Medium - Important for booking visualization
**Complexity**: Medium - Complex date-based rendering

**Key Test Areas**:
- Calendar rendering
- Date selection functionality
- Booking visualization
- Calendar navigation

**Test Cases**:
- Test calendar renders correctly
- Test date selection works correctly
- Test bookings are visualized correctly on the calendar
- Test calendar navigation (month/week view, next/previous)
- Test booking details are displayed correctly when a booking is selected

### 5. Settings Widgets

**Importance**: Medium - Important for app configuration
**Complexity**: Medium - Forms and dialogs

**Key Test Areas**:
- Settings form rendering
- Import/export functionality
- Data seeding dialog
- Theme settings

**Test Cases**:
- Test settings screen renders correctly
- Test import/export buttons are enabled/disabled correctly
- Test data seeding dialog renders correctly
- Test theme settings update correctly

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: High Priority Widgets**
   - Implement tests for Dashboard widgets
   - Implement tests for Booking form widgets
   - Implement tests for Gear management widgets
   - Review and refine tests

2. **Phase 2: Medium Priority Widgets**
   - Implement tests for Calendar widgets
   - Implement tests for Settings widgets
   - Review and refine tests

3. **Phase 3: Low Priority Widgets**
   - Implement tests for remaining widgets
   - Review and refine tests

## Test Execution

1. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test test/widgets/
   ```

2. **Generating Coverage Reports**
   ```bash
   flutter test --coverage
   genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
   ```

3. **Reviewing Coverage**
   - Open coverage/html/index.html in a browser
   - Focus on improving coverage for critical widgets

## Best Practices

1. **Widget Test Structure**
   - Use `testWidgets` function for widget tests
   - Use `pumpWidget` to render widgets
   - Use `find` methods to locate widgets in the widget tree
   - Use `tap`, `enterText`, etc. to simulate user interactions
   - Use `pump` or `pumpAndSettle` to rebuild the widget tree after interactions

2. **Mocking Dependencies**
   - Use Mockito to mock controllers and services
   - Provide mock data for testing
   - Mock navigation and context-dependent functionality

3. **Testing User Interactions**
   - Test tapping buttons and other interactive elements
   - Test entering text in text fields
   - Test selecting items from dropdowns and lists
   - Test scrolling in scrollable widgets

4. **Testing State Changes**
   - Verify that widgets update correctly when state changes
   - Test error states and loading states
   - Test empty states and edge cases

## Maintenance

1. **Updating Tests**
   - Update tests when widget functionality changes
   - Add new tests for new widgets
   - Refactor tests when widget code is refactored

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests on every pull request
   - Enforce minimum coverage thresholds
   - Block merges if tests fail

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a structured approach to testing the UI components in the BLKWDS Manager application. By following this plan, we can ensure that the UI components render correctly, respond to user interactions appropriately, and integrate properly with their controllers, leading to a more robust and reliable application.
