## System Requirements

- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- 500MB free storage space
- 7-inch screen or larger (10-inch recommended)

## Android-Specific Features

### Touch Optimization

BLKWDS Manager for Android has been optimized for touch interaction:

- Larger touch targets for buttons and interactive elements
- Swipe gestures for navigation between related screens
- Long-press actions for additional options
- Pinch-to-zoom for detailed views

### Screen Orientation

The app supports both portrait and landscape orientations:

- **Portrait Mode**: Optimized for data entry and form filling
- **Landscape Mode**: Ideal for calendar views and data visualization

The interface will automatically adjust based on your device's orientation.

### Performance Considerations

For optimal performance on older tablets:

- The app automatically detects your device capabilities and adjusts UI complexity
- Image loading is optimized with efficient caching
- List views use pagination to handle large datasets smoothly
- Memory usage is carefully managed to prevent slowdowns

If you experience performance issues, try these steps:
1. Close other applications running in the background
2. Restart the app
3. Ensure your device has sufficient free storage space
4. Restart your device

## Navigation Differences

The Android version uses a slightly different navigation pattern:

- The sidebar menu is accessed via a hamburger icon in the top-left corner
- A persistent home button is available to quickly return to the dashboard
- Back navigation uses the standard Android back button or gesture
- Context menus are accessed via long-press instead of right-click

## Data Synchronization

The Android version stores data locally on your device. If you're using both desktop and Android versions:

- Use the export/import feature to transfer data between devices
- Export your data regularly as a backup
- Be aware that changes made on one device won't automatically appear on others

## Battery Optimization

To maximize battery life while using BLKWDS Manager:

- Reduce screen brightness
- Use dark mode (enabled by default)
- Close the app when not in use
- Consider connecting to power during extended use

## Troubleshooting Android-Specific Issues

### Installation Problems

### Performance Issues
