# Booking System Guide

The Booking System in BLKWDS Manager helps you schedule gear and studio usage, ensuring resources are available when needed and preventing double-bookings.

## Accessing the Booking System

2. You'll see the booking calendar by default

## Viewing Bookings

The Booking System offers two main views:

- **List View**: Detailed list of all bookings

### Calendar View

The Calendar View shows bookings in a timeline format:

- **Day View**: Detailed view of a single day
- **Week View**: Overview of the current week
- **Month View**: High-level view of the month

You can switch between these views using the buttons at the top of the calendar.

### List View

The List View shows all bookings in a sortable, filterable list:

- Click column headers to sort
- Use the filter options to narrow down the list
- Click on any booking to view details

## Creating a New Booking

1. Click the "New Booking" button
2. Fill in the booking details:
   - **Project**: Select the associated project
   - **Start Date/Time**: When the booking begins
   - **End Date/Time**: When the booking ends
   - **Title**: A descriptive name for the booking (defaults to project name)
   - **Notes**: Any additional information (optional)
3. Select resources:
   - **Gear**: Choose equipment to include in the booking
   - **Studio**: Reserve studio space if needed
   - **Team Members**: Assign team members to the booking
4. Assign gear to team members (optional):
   - For each gear item, you can assign a responsible team member
   - This helps track who has what equipment
5. Click "Save Booking"

## Editing a Booking

1. Click on the booking in the calendar or list view
2. Click the "Edit" button
3. Update the information as needed
4. Click "Save Changes"

## Canceling a Booking

1. Click on the booking in the calendar or list view
2. Click the "Cancel Booking" button
3. Confirm the cancellation

**Note**: Canceling a booking will release all reserved gear and studio space.

## Recurring Bookings

For regular shoots or meetings:

1. Create a new booking as usual
2. Check the "Recurring" option
3. Set the recurrence pattern:
   - **Frequency**: Daily, Weekly, Monthly
   - **Interval**: Every X days/weeks/months
   - **End Date**: When the recurrence should stop
4. Click "Save Booking"

## Conflict Detection

BLKWDS Manager automatically detects booking conflicts:

- If gear is already booked for the selected time period, you'll see a warning
- If a studio is already reserved, you'll be notified
- If a team member is already assigned to another booking, you'll be alerted

You can still create the booking with conflicts if necessary, but you'll need to acknowledge the overlap.

## Filtering and Searching

### Filtering

Use the filter options to narrow down the bookings:

- **Project**: Show only bookings for a specific project
- **Date Range**: Limit to a specific time period
- **Gear**: Show bookings that include specific gear
- **Studio**: Show bookings for a particular studio
- **Team Member**: Show bookings assigned to a specific person

### Searching

Use the search bar to find specific bookings:

1. Click on the search bar at the top
2. Type a project name, booking title, or other identifying information
3. Results will update as you type

## Booking Reports

Generate reports about your bookings:

1. Click the "Reports" button
2. Select the type of report:
   - **Upcoming Bookings**: Future scheduled bookings
   - **Booking History**: Past bookings
   - **Resource Utilization**: How often gear or studios are booked
   - **Team Schedule**: Bookings by team member
3. Set any filters or date ranges
4. Click "Generate Report"
5. Export to PDF or CSV if needed

## Calendar Integration

BLKWDS Manager can integrate with external calendars:

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Use detailed titles and notes to clarify the purpose of each booking
- **Check Conflicts**: Review the conflict warnings before confirming a booking
- **Update Promptly**: If plans change, update or cancel bookings immediately to free up resources
