# Database Reliability Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Unconditional Data Seeding
**Problem:** The application was unconditionally seeding the database on every startup, which could lead to data loss or unexpected state changes.

**Solution:**
- Made data seeding conditional based on app configuration
- Added comprehensive checks to ensure the database is empty before seeding
- Added proper logging and error handling
- Created a new UI for controlling data seeding
- Added configuration options in AppConfig to control seeding behavior

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/main.dart`
- `lib/services/data_seeder.dart`
- `lib/models/app_config.dart`
- `lib/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart`
- Created `lib/widgets/dialogs/data_seeding_dialog.dart`

### 2. Booking Model Inconsistency
**Problem:** The Booking model didn't match the database schema, with missing fields and inconsistent naming.

**Solution:**
- Updated the Booking model to include studioId and notes fields
- Updated all related methods (fromMap, toMap, fromJson, toJson, copyWith)
- Updated equality and toString methods
- Removed runtime column checks that were compensating for the inconsistency

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/booking.dart`
- `lib/services/db_service.dart`
- `lib/services/database_validator.dart`

### 3. DatabaseValidator Issues
**Problem:** The DatabaseValidator had its own schema definitions that were different from the ones in DBService, leading to inconsistencies.

**Solution:**
- Created a single source of truth for schema definitions (SchemaDefinitions class)
- Updated the DatabaseValidator to use the SchemaDefinitions
- Fixed column name inconsistencies (startTime/endTime vs startDate/endDate)
- Ensured all tables and columns are properly defined

**Files Modified:**
- Created `lib/services/schema_definitions.dart`
- `lib/services/database_validator.dart`
- `lib/services/db_service.dart`

### 4. Improved Data Seeding Configuration
**Problem:** Data seeding was not configurable and lacked user control.

**Solution:**
- Added configuration options to control data seeding
- Created a new UI for managing data seeding
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Made data seeding more explicit and user-controlled

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/app_config.dart`
- `lib/services/data_seeder.dart`
- Created `lib/widgets/dialogs/data_seeding_dialog.dart`
- `lib/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart`
