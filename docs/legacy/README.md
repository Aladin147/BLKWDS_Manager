# Legacy Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that are no longer current but are kept for historical reference. These files may contain outdated information, plans that have been superseded, or implementation details that have changed.

## Why Keep Legacy Documentation?

1. **Historical Context**: Understanding past decisions and approaches
2. **Reference for Similar Future Work**: Learning from previous implementations
3. **Tracking Project Evolution**: Seeing how the project has changed over time

## Current Documentation

For current project status and plans, please refer to these primary documents:

1. [Project Status](../project_status.md) - Single source of truth for current project status
2. [Journal](../Journal.md) - Chronological record of development activities
3. [Architecture Simplification Plan](../architecture/simplification_plan.md) - Current architectural direction

## Legacy Files

The files in this directory are tagged with `[LEGACY]` in their titles and include a warning header to indicate they are no longer current. They should not be used for current development decisions without verifying against current documentation.

## Recent Additions

As part of our documentation audit on 2025-06-25, we've moved several outdated implementation plans and documentation files to this directory to ensure our active documentation remains accurate and up-to-date.
