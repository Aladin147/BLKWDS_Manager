## 2025-06-07: Error Handling System Implementation Decision

Today we made the decision to prioritize implementing our comprehensive error handling system before proceeding with the final code cleanup phase. After reviewing the current state of the codebase and our existing error handling design, we determined that this is the optimal sequence for several reasons:

1. **Architectural Foundation is Ready**: With the architecture flattening complete, we now have a clean foundation for implementing the error handling system.

2. **Prevents Rework**: Implementing error handling before code cleanup prevents us from having to modify the cleaned code again, creating inefficiency.

3. **Testing Benefits**: Having error handling in place during the testing phase will make it easier to identify and diagnose issues.

4. **User Experience**: The snackbar notifications (which are part of the error handling system) will improve user feedback during testing.

5. **Completeness**: It makes more sense to clean up code that already includes error handling rather than cleaning up code and then adding error handling afterward.

We've created a comprehensive implementation plan in `docs/error_handling_implementation_plan.md` that outlines the approach we'll take to integrate the error handling system throughout the application. The plan includes:

1. **Phase 1: Core Error Handling Integration** (1-2 days)
   - Integrate error handling into controllers
   - Update UI components to display error states
   - Implement proper error logging throughout the application
   - Add snackbar notifications for user feedback

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Error Recovery** (1-2 days)
   - Implement retry logic for network and database operations
   - Add recovery mechanisms for critical operations
   - Create fallback UI for error states
   - Implement graceful degradation for unavailable features

3. **Phase 3: Error Analytics and Monitoring** (1 day)
   - Implement error tracking throughout the application
   - Create error analytics dashboard
   - Add error reporting functionality
   - Implement error trend analysis

This approach aligns with our core principles of completing core functionalities before refactoring and ensuring proper error handling before adding new features. It also follows our principle of fixing errors and issues before continuing with new implementations.
