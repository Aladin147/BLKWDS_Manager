## 2025-06-07: Studio Migration Cleanup - Phase 2

Continuing our work on the studio migration cleanup, we focused on removing feature flags and compatibility layers. This is the second phase of our architecture simplification plan.

Key accomplishments:

1. **Feature Flag Removal**:
   - Removed all feature flags related to the studio system
   - Deprecated the FeatureFlags class as all features are now enabled by default
   - Removed the migration UI from the settings screen

2. **Database Layer Cleanup**:
   - Removed V2 suffix from database methods (insertBookingV2 â†’ insertBooking, etc.)
   - Updated all references to use the new method names
   - Fixed duplicate method declarations in DBService

3. **Compatibility Layer Removal**:
   - Simplified the compatibility layer in the DBService
   - Made compatibility methods simple aliases to the standard methods
   - Ensured backward compatibility while reducing code complexity

These changes have further simplified the codebase and removed unnecessary complexity. The application is now more maintainable and easier to understand, with a cleaner architecture and fewer layers of indirection.
