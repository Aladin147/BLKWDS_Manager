## 🚫 Phase 4 – Explicitly Out of Scope (for now)
| Feature                | Reason for exclusion              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Mobile app version     | Avoid platform maintenance         |
| Cloud sync             | Complexity + privacy concerns      |
| User login/auth        | Not needed for internal tool       |
| Inventory scanning (QR/RFID) | Too much hardware scope creep |

---

## 🧩 Philosophy
> Stay beautiful. Stay useful. Never overbuild.
This app serves the studio — it shouldn't feel like a chore to maintain or use.

Every new feature must:
- Reduce friction
- Improve clarity
- Preserve elegance

If it doesn't do all three, it doesn't get built.

This roadmap evolves only when needs do. MVP is already powerful — every phase after is just refinement.
