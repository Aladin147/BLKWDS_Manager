## ðŸš« Phase 4 â€“ Explicitly Out of Scope (for now)
| Feature                | Reason for exclusion              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Mobile app version     | Avoid platform maintenance         |
| Cloud sync             | Complexity + privacy concerns      |
| User login/auth        | Not needed for internal tool       |
| Inventory scanning (QR/RFID) | Too much hardware scope creep |

---

## ðŸ§© Philosophy
> Stay beautiful. Stay useful. Never overbuild.
This app serves the studio â€” it shouldnâ€™t feel like a chore to maintain or use.

Every new feature must:
- Reduce friction
- Improve clarity
- Preserve elegance

If it doesnâ€™t do all three, it doesnâ€™t get built.

This roadmap evolves only when needs do. MVP is already powerful â€” every phase after is just refinement.
