## 2025-06-07: Studio Migration Cleanup - Phase 3

Today we focused on flattening the architecture by consolidating controllers and simplifying adapters. This is the third phase of our architecture simplification plan.

Key accomplishments:

1. **Controller Consolidation**:
   - Removed BookingPanelControllerV2 and kept only BookingPanelController
   - Removed the V2 suffix from all components
   - Updated all references to use the consolidated controller

2. **Adapter Simplification**:
   - Updated BookingListScreenAdapter, BookingDetailScreenAdapter, and CalendarViewAdapter to work with the consolidated controller
   - Removed unnecessary conditional logic that was handling multiple controller types
   - Simplified the adapter interfaces

3. **Component Interface Standardization**:
   - Ensured all components use consistent naming and interfaces
   - Removed V2 suffixes from all components
   - Updated imports and references
   - Reduced indirection between UI and business logic

These changes have significantly simplified the codebase and made it more maintainable. The application now has a cleaner architecture with fewer layers of indirection, making it easier to understand and extend.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Studio Migration** (✓ Completed)
   - ✓ Remove all feature flags
   - ✓ Delete remaining compatibility layer components
   - ✓ Update UI components to work directly with the new models

2. **Flatten Architecture** (✓ Completed)
   - ✓ Simplify controller hierarchy
   - ✓ Remove unnecessary adapters
   - ✓ Standardize component interfaces
   - ✓ Reduce indirection between UI and business logic

3. **Code Cleanup** (1-2 days)
   - Remove unused code
   - Fix remaining UI issues
   - Add missing documentation
   - Standardize naming conventions

4. **Testing** (1-2 days)
   - Comprehensive testing of all features
   - Fix any regressions
   - Performance optimization

5. **Finalize Phase 1 (MVP)**
   - Update documentation to reflect completion
   - Tag codebase as v1.0.0
   - Conduct final review of all features
