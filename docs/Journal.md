# BLKWDS Manager - Development Journal

## 2025-05-09: UI Consistency Improvements

Today we implemented several UI improvements to ensure consistency across the application:

1. **Standardized List Item Component**: Created a `BLKWDSListItem` component for consistent list styling across the app.

2. **Standardized Icon Component**: Created a `BLKWDSIcon` component with consistent sizing options (extraSmall, small, medium, large, extraLarge).

3. **Standardized Status Badge Component**: Created a `BLKWDSStatusBadge` component for consistent status indicators.

4. **Updated Existing Screens**: Updated the booking panel, calendar view, and dashboard to use the standardized components.

5. **Fixed Text Overflow Issues**: Added proper overflow handling to prevent text from being cut off.

6. **Improved Spacing Consistency**: Added extra small spacing constant and ensured consistent spacing throughout the app.

These changes have significantly improved the visual consistency of the application and will make future UI development more efficient.

## 2025-05-07: Error Handling Implementation

Today we implemented a comprehensive error handling system for the BLKWDS Manager application. The key components include:

1. **LogService**: A centralized logging service with different log levels (debug, info, warning, error) that provides structured logging with timestamps and context.

2. **ErrorService**: A centralized error handling service that provides user-friendly error messages based on error types (database, network, validation, auth, unknown).

3. **Global Error Handling**: Implemented error handling at multiple levels:
   - Flutter framework errors caught by `FlutterError.onError`
   - Widget tree errors caught by custom `ErrorWidget.builder`
   - Navigation errors caught by `onUnknownRoute`
   - Custom error widget for better user experience

4. **Database Error Handling**: Improved error handling in the database service with proper stack trace logging and transaction rollback.

5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the error handling system in `error_handling.md`.

All print statements in the codebase have been replaced with structured logging, and error handling has been added to critical parts of the application. This will make debugging easier and provide a better user experience when errors occur.

## 2025-05-06: Model Alignment

Fixed database schema and model mismatches:

1. Updated Member model to remove email and phone fields to match database schema
2. Updated Project model to remove description field to match database schema
3. Fixed all references to removed fields in controllers and UI components
4. Updated documentation to reflect model changes

These changes have successfully aligned the models with the database schema, making the codebase more consistent and reducing the risk of errors.

## 2025-05-05: Bug Fixes

Fixed several issues:

1. Fixed asset directory issues in pubspec.yaml causing build failures
2. Fixed database schema mismatches between models and actual database tables
3. Updated deprecated withOpacity calls to withValues in UI components
4. Added proper library directive to widget barrel file
5. Created missing asset directories with placeholder files

## 2025-05-03: Calendar Drag-and-Drop

Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for booking rescheduling in the calendar view:

1. Added visual feedback during drag operations with enhanced styling
2. Implemented conflict detection to prevent invalid rescheduling
3. Added placeholder for original booking location during drag operations
4. Created comprehensive documentation for the calendar drag-and-drop functionality

Also fixed issues with calendar day rendering and interaction, improved error handling in booking operations, and enhanced visual feedback for user actions.

## 2025-05-14: UI/UX Enhancement Phase 1

Implemented the first phase of UI/UX enhancements to create a more polished and professional look and feel:

1. **Animation System**: Created a comprehensive animation system with standardized durations, curves, and transitions:
   - Implemented fade, slide, and scale transitions
   - Added hover and press animations
   - Created loading animations and progress indicators

2. **Shadow System**: Implemented a multi-level shadow system for visual hierarchy:
   - Created shadow levels for different elevations
   - Added state-based shadows (hover, active, focus, error, success, warning)
   - Implemented colored shadows for visual feedback

3. **Gradient System**: Added gradient support for visual interest:
   - Created standard gradients for primary, secondary, and accent colors
   - Implemented button and card gradients
   - Added background gradients for depth

4. **Enhanced Components**:
   - Updated `BLKWDSCard` with animations, shadows, gradients, and loading states
   - Created enhanced `BLKWDSButton` with animations, shadows, gradients, and loading states
   - Added new button types (success, warning, text, icon)
   - Implemented custom loading spinner with BLKWDS branding

5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the UI/UX enhancements in `ui_enhancements.md`.

These enhancements have significantly improved the visual appeal and interactivity of the application, creating a more engaging user experience.

## Next Steps

1. Implement UI/UX Enhancement Phase 2 (screen transitions and layout animations)
2. Add comprehensive testing (unit and integration tests)
3. Implement remaining UI components with enhanced styling
