# UI Audit Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist is used to systematically identify UI issues that cause cognitive fatigue during development. The focus is on finding and documenting issues that make development tedious or frustrating, not on comprehensive UI/UX redesign.

## Text & Typography

### Readability

- [ ] Success/error states are visually distinct
- [ ] Interactive elements are obviously interactive

### Error States

- [ ] Error messages are helpful and specific
- [ ] Recovery from errors is straightforward

## Visual Consistency

### Color Usage
- [ ] Colors from the theme are used consistently

## Priority Rating
For each issue identified, assign a priority:
- **High**: Causes significant cognitive fatigue, impedes development
- **Medium**: Causes moderate cognitive fatigue, slows development
- **Low**: Causes minor cognitive fatigue, slightly annoying
