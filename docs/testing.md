# BLKWDS Manager - Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and implementation for the BLKWDS Manager application. The testing approach includes unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests to ensure the application functions correctly and reliably.

## Testing Structure

The testing structure is organized as follows:

```
/test
 ├── run_all_tests.dart        # Script to run all tests
 ├── test_helpers.dart         # Common test utilities
 ├── widget_test.dart          # Basic widget test
 ├── mocks/                    # Mock implementations for testing
 │   └── mock_db_service.dart  # Mock database service
 ├── unit/                     # Unit tests
 │   ├── models/               # Tests for data models
 │   ├── services/             # Tests for services
 │   └── controllers/          # Tests for controllers
 └── widget/                   # Widget tests
     └── dashboard_test.dart   # Tests for dashboard widgets

/integration_test
 └── app_test.dart             # End-to-end integration tests
```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify that individual units of code (functions, methods, classes) work as expected in isolation. They focus on testing the business logic without dependencies on external systems.

**Examples:**
- Model tests: Verify that models can be created, converted to/from maps, and compared correctly
- Service tests: Verify that services handle errors correctly and return expected results

### Widget Tests

Widget tests verify that UI components render correctly and respond to user interactions as expected. They focus on testing the presentation layer.

**Examples:**
- Screen tests: Verify that screens render correctly and display the expected content
- Component tests: Verify that UI components respond to user interactions correctly

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly. They focus on testing the application as a whole.

**Examples:**
- Navigation tests: Verify that navigation between screens works correctly
- End-to-end tests: Verify that complete user flows work correctly

## Running Tests

### Running Unit and Widget Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
flutter test test/unit/models/gear_test.dart
```

To run all tests:

```bash
flutter test test/run_all_tests.dart
```

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
```

## Test Coverage

To generate test coverage reports:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

This will generate a `coverage/lcov.info` file that can be used to generate HTML reports using tools like `lcov`.

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, action, and verification phases
3. **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocks to isolate the code being tested from external dependencies
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for error conditions and edge cases
5. **Keep Tests Fast**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent testing
6. **Test Readability**: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain

## Future Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more tests to cover all parts of the application
2. **Automated UI Testing**: Add more comprehensive UI tests using tools like Flutter Driver
3. **Performance Testing**: Add tests to verify that the application performs well under load
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Add tests to verify that the application is accessible to all users
