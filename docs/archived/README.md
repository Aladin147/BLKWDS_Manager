## Why Archive?

Documentation is archived when:

1. It has been superseded by newer documentation
2. The feature or system it describes has been fully implemented
3. The approach or design has changed significantly

Archived documentation should not be used as a reference for current development, but may provide valuable context for understanding the evolution of the system.
