   - Ensured consistent icon usage throughout the app

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated journal.md to document our work

These improvements enhance the visual consistency and professionalism of the app. The standardized icons are more intuitive and provide better visual cues for users.

## 2025-07-14: Codebase Cleanup and Adapter Removal

Today we focused on cleaning up the codebase by removing unused adapter classes and other unnecessary code:

1. **Adapter Removal**:
   - Removed BookingFormAdapter and updated references to use BookingForm directly
   - Removed BookingListScreenAdapter and updated references to use BookingListScreen directly
   - Removed BookingDetailScreenAdapter and updated references to use BookingDetailScreen directly

   - Updated journal.md to document our work

These improvements simplify the architecture and make the codebase more maintainable. We've removed unnecessary layers of indirection that were adding complexity without providing any benefits.

## 2025-07-14: Dashboard Layout Responsiveness and Image Loading Fixes

Today we focused on improving the dashboard layout responsiveness and fixing image loading issues:

1. **Dashboard Layout Responsiveness**:
   - Replaced fixed heights with ConstrainedBox widgets to improve responsiveness
   - Used MediaQuery to determine layout based on screen width
   - Standardized padding using BLKWDSConstants

Next steps include improving dashboard layout responsiveness, updating placeholder data in Settings, and cleaning up unused controllers and adapters.

## 2025-07-12: Performance and Stress Testing Framework

Today we implemented a comprehensive performance and stress testing framework for the application. This framework allows us to measure and monitor various aspects of the application's performance, including database operations, UI responsiveness, and memory usage.

The framework consists of several key components:

1. **PerformanceMonitor**:
   - Core utility for measuring and logging performance metrics
   - Tracks custom metrics with timing information
   - Monitors frame rates and dropped frames
   - Tracks memory usage over time
   - Generates detailed performance reports

2. **DatabasePerformanceTester**:
   - Tests database initialization performance
   - Measures CRUD operation performance for all entity types
   - Tests cache hit ratio and effectiveness
   - Tests transaction performance
   - Generates large datasets for stress testing

3. **UIPerformanceTester**:
   - Tests navigation performance between screens
   - Measures scrolling performance on list screens
   - Tests animation performance
   - Monitors frame rates during UI interactions

4. **MemoryLeakDetector**:
   - Tests for memory leaks during navigation cycles
   - Tests for memory leaks during data loading
   - Tests for memory leaks during widget creation
   - Monitors memory growth over time

5. **PerformanceTestScreen**:
   - User interface for running performance tests
   - Displays test results in a readable format
   - Allows exporting test results
   - Integrated into the Settings screen

We also enhanced the CacheService with improved statistics tracking and reporting capabilities, including:

- Cache hit ratio tracking
- Compression statistics
- Access pattern analysis
- Smart cache management

This work completes the Testing Improvements section of our Beta Readiness Plan. The performance and stress testing framework will help us identify and address performance issues before the beta release, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Next steps include focusing on UI/UX finalization, starting with verifying and completing the Export to CSV functionality.

## 2025-07-12: Unit Tests for Critical Components

Today we focused on adding unit tests for critical components in the application. We identified that the GearManagementController was a critical component that lacked proper unit tests.

Our approach involved:

1. **Creating a GearManagementController Class**:
   - Extracted gear management logic from the GearListScreen into a dedicated controller class
   - Implemented proper state management using ValueNotifiers
   - Added comprehensive error handling and validation
   - Implemented methods for gear operations (load, delete, check-in, check-out)
   - Added filtering capabilities for the gear list

2. **Implementing Unit Tests**:
   - Created a test suite for the GearManagementController
   - Tested initialization and state management
   - Tested filtering functionality with different search criteria
   - Tested the getGearById method for both existing and non-existent IDs
   - Ensured all tests pass consistently

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Improved code organization with proper separation of concerns
   - Enhanced testability of gear management functionality
   - Increased test coverage for critical components
   - Provided a foundation for future controller tests

This work addresses a key item in our Beta Readiness Plan by adding missing unit tests for critical components. The GearManagementController is now properly tested, which will help ensure the reliability of gear management functionality in the application.

Next steps include implementing performance and stress tests, which is the final item in the Testing Improvements section of our Beta Readiness Plan.

## 2025-07-12: Integration Test Improvements

Today we focused on fixing the runtime issues in our integration tests. We identified several key issues that were causing the tests to be flaky and unreliable:

1. **Timing Issues**: The tests were relying on `tester.pumpAndSettle()` which can be problematic with continuous animations or network requests.
2. **Widget Finding Issues**: Some widgets might not be found due to changes in the UI structure or text.
3. **Navigation Issues**: The tests were using direct navigation methods which might not work as expected.
4. **Test Data Cleanup**: The cleanup might not be reliable if tests fail before reaching the cleanup code.
5. **Long Press Gesture**: The long press gesture in project_management_flow_test.dart was unreliable.

To address these issues, we enhanced the IntegrationTestHelpers class with several new methods:

1. **Improved waitForAppStability**: Enhanced the method to be more resilient to continuous animations and to provide better logging.
2. **Enhanced scrollUntilVisible**: Made the scrolling more reliable by using pump instead of pumpAndSettle and adding better error handling.
3. **Added longPressWithRetry**: Created a new method to perform long press gestures with retry logic.
4. **Added waitForWidget**: Added a method to wait for a specific widget to appear with a configurable timeout.
5. **Added waitForWidgetToDisappear**: Added a method to wait for a specific widget to disappear with a configurable timeout.

We then updated the integration test files to use these enhanced helpers:

1. **project_management_flow_test.dart**: Updated the long press and deletion verification to use the new helpers.
2. **gear_checkout_flow_test.dart**: Enhanced the gear check-in/out verification to wait for the UI to update.
3. **booking_creation_flow_test.dart**: Improved the navigation back to the dashboard to use the home button when available.

These improvements make the integration tests more reliable and less prone to flakiness. The tests now have better error handling, more robust widget finding, and more reliable gesture handling.

We've updated the project_status.md file to mark this task as completed and will continue with the next items in our Beta Readiness Plan.

## 2025-07-12: Comprehensive Testing Checklist Implementation
