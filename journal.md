## 2025-06-30: Comprehensive Navigation and Routing Standardization

Today we completed the standardization of navigation and routing throughout the application:

1. **Added Missing Navigation Methods**:
   - Added navigateToAppConfig, navigateToAppInfo, and navigateToDatabaseIntegrity methods to NavigationService
   - Added corresponding routes to AppRoutes class
   - Ensured all screens have dedicated navigation methods

2. **Fixed Form Screen Navigation**:
   - Updated AddGearScreen to use NavigationService.goBack instead of direct Navigator.pop
   - Updated GearFormScreen to use NavigationService.goBack
   - Updated MemberFormScreen to use NavigationService.goBack
   - Updated ProjectFormScreen to use NavigationService.goBack
   - Ensured proper data refresh when returning from edit screens

3. **Standardized Settings Screen Navigation**:
   - Updated SettingsScreen to use NavigationService.instance instead of NavigationService()
   - Updated all navigation calls to use the appropriate navigation methods
   - Removed unused imports and cleaned up the code

4. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Completed the standardization of navigation across the entire application
   - Improved code maintainability with centralized navigation logic
   - Enhanced user experience with consistent transitions
   - Simplified screen navigation with dedicated methods

This work completes the navigation standardization task, which was one of the remaining UI/UX improvements needed before internal deployment. The application now has a consistent navigation pattern throughout, making it more maintainable and providing a better user experience.

## 2025-06-30: Navigation and Routing Improvements

Today we focused on fixing navigation and routing issues in the application:

1. **Standardized Navigation Service**:
   - Added new navigation methods to NavigationService for member, project, gear, and booking screens
   - Updated AppRoutes to include all necessary routes
   - Implemented consistent transition animations for different types of navigation

2. **Refactored Screen Navigation**:
   - Updated MemberListScreen to use NavigationService instead of direct Navigator calls
   - Updated ProjectListScreen to use NavigationService instead of direct Navigator calls
   - Updated GearListScreen to use NavigationService instead of direct Navigator calls
   - Updated BookingPanelScreen to use NavigationService instead of direct Navigator calls
   - Ensured proper data refresh when returning from child screens

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - More consistent navigation behavior throughout the app
   - Better maintainability with centralized navigation logic
   - Improved user experience with consistent transitions
   - Fixed potential issues with screen refresh after navigation

This work addresses a key usability issue by ensuring that all navigation paths work correctly and consistently. The next steps will be to continue this standardization for the remaining screens in the application.

## 2025-06-30: Test Coverage Improvements

Today we focused on improving test coverage for the application:

1. **Model Tests**:
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for Project model
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for Studio model
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for BookingV2 model
   - Updated test helpers to work with the new BookingV2 model

2. **DBService Tests**:
   - Updated existing tests to work with the new BookingV2 model
   - Fixed a bug in the deleteBooking method that wasn't properly deleting associated booking_gear records
   - Implemented the fix using a transaction to ensure both the booking and its gear assignments are deleted atomically

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Improved test coverage for critical models
   - Fixed a data integrity issue with booking deletion
   - Ensured tests work with the latest model versions
   - Prevented potential orphaned records in the booking_gear table

This work completes another key task in our preparation for internal deployment. The improved test coverage will help catch regressions, and the fixed deleteBooking method ensures proper data cleanup when bookings are deleted.
