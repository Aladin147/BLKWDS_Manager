## 2025-07-22: Enhanced Visual Distinction for Gear Check-in/out States

Today we improved the visual distinction between gear check-in and check-out states to make it easier to identify gear status at a glance:

1. **Enhanced Card Styling for Checked-out Gear**:
   - Added a subtle amber background color to cards for checked-out gear
   - Added a border with the status color for better visual indication
   - This creates an immediate visual cue that the gear is in an altered state (checked out)

2. **Improved Status Badge Visibility**:
   - Enhanced the status badge with larger font size
   - Added proper padding for better readability
   - Added shadow effect to make the badge stand out more

3. **Color-coded Action Buttons**:
   - Changed the "Check Out" button to use the statusOut color (amber)
   - Changed the "Check In" button to use the statusIn color (green)
   - This creates a consistent color system where the button color matches the action's resulting state

These improvements make it much easier to distinguish between checked-in and checked-out gear at a glance, improving the user experience and reducing the chance of errors when managing equipment.

## 2025-07-22: Created Beta-Android Branch and Optimization Plan

Today we created a new branch called "Beta-Android" that will become our new default main branch for the Android tablet version of the application. We also developed a comprehensive optimization plan to improve performance on older tablets, clean up legacy code, and enhance overall code quality.

1. **Created Beta-Android Branch**:
   - Created a new branch from the current android-ui-enhancements branch
   - This branch will serve as the foundation for our Android tablet optimization efforts
   - Will become the new default main branch once optimizations are complete

2. **Developed Comprehensive Optimization Plan**:
   - Created a detailed plan with 6 implementation phases
   - Documented the plan in docs/optimization_plan.md
   - Updated project_status.md to reference the new plan
   - Set clear success criteria for each phase

3. **Started Phase 1: Critical Fixes**:
   - Fixed FontWeight.medium errors in text styles
   - Removed unused imports in main.dart
   - Identified critical static analysis warnings to address

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Continue with Phase 1 by addressing critical static analysis warnings
   - Update booking widget to remove legacy studio flags
   - Fix parameter type mismatches
   - Begin performance optimization for older tablets

This optimization plan will help us systematically improve the application for Android tablets, ensuring it runs smoothly even on older devices while maintaining code quality and reducing technical debt.
