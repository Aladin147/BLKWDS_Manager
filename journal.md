   - Replaced direct transactions with DBServiceWrapper.executeTransaction for better error handling

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error handling across all database operations
   - Uniform retry mechanisms for transient errors
   - Better error reporting with operation names

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Improved code maintainability with standardized patterns
   - Enhanced reliability for database operations
   - Better error reporting and tracking
   - Consistent retry mechanisms for transient errors

This work addresses one of our critical issues by standardizing database operations across the application. The application now provides consistent error handling and retry mechanisms for database operations, which is a significant step forward in our reliability strategy.

Next steps include implementing tests for critical models and fixing the navigation issues.

## 2025-06-27: Database Operations Refactoring Plan

Today we created a comprehensive plan for refactoring the remaining database operations in DBService. This work involved several key activities:

1. **Created Refactoring Strategy**:
   - Detailed implementation strategy for using DBServiceWrapper consistently
   - Prioritization framework for database operation refactoring
   - Example refactoring patterns for different operation types

2. **Identified Benefits**:
   - Consistent error handling across all database operations
   - Uniform retry mechanisms for transient errors

   - Better debugging and error reporting

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Audit all database operations in DBService
   - Refactor operations by type (query, insert, update, delete, transaction)
   - Add appropriate operation names for better error tracking
   - Test refactored operations for correctness and error handling
   - Document refactoring patterns for future reference

This work provides a clear plan for refactoring the remaining database operations in DBService. The plan will guide our future work and help us prioritize our efforts.

Next steps include reorganizing the documentation structure and implementing the refactoring plan.

## 2025-06-26: Database Integrity System Tests

Today we implemented a comprehensive test suite for the database integrity system. This work involved several key improvements:

1. **Added Unit Tests**:
   - Unit tests for DatabaseIntegrityChecker
   - Unit tests for DatabaseIntegrityRepair functionality
   - Unit tests for DatabaseIntegrityService
   - Test helpers for creating database corruption scenarios

2. **Fixed Edge Cases**:
   - Date format handling in integrity repair operations
   - Error handling in integrity service
   - Edge cases in database integrity checks

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Improved test coverage for database-related components
   - Enhanced robustness of integrity check and repair operations
   - Better documentation for database integrity system
   - Increased confidence in database integrity mechanisms

This work addresses one of our critical testing issues by providing comprehensive test coverage for the database integrity system. The system now has proper tests that verify its functionality, which is a significant step forward in our testing strategy.

Next steps include creating a plan for refactoring the remaining database operations in DBService.

## 2025-05-16: Code Quality Improvements

Today we made several improvements to the code quality. This work involved several key improvements:

1. **Updated Constructor Syntax**:
   - Updated all widget constructors to use the modern `super.key` parameter syntax
   - Improved widget structure by placing child parameters last in widget constructors
   - Replaced Container with SizedBox where appropriate for better performance

2. **Fixed Critical Bugs**:
   - Fixed a critical bug in the `clearAllData` method that was trying to delete from a non-existent table
   - Replaced all print statements with proper LogService calls
   - Fixed unnecessary 'this.' qualifiers in extension methods
   - Fixed animation-related code to use modern Flutter APIs
   - Fixed deprecated color methods

3. **Added Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive error logging with stack traces
   - Proper documentation for database schema changes
   - Improved error handling and reporting

4. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Improved code quality and maintainability
   - Fixed critical bugs that could cause data loss
   - Enhanced error logging and reporting
   - Better performance with optimized widget usage

This work addresses several critical issues by improving the code quality and fixing critical bugs. The application now has better error logging and reporting, which is a significant step forward in our reliability strategy.

Next steps include implementing a comprehensive test suite for the database integrity system.
